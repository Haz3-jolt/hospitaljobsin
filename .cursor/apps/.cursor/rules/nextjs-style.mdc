- Use Next.js to build the frontends
- Make sure to use client side components wherever possible. Use RSC and Server Side Rendering only when SEO is required
- Use typescript for type safety
- Use environment variables (parsed by the `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` library) for configuration
- Follow Next.js naming conventions for special files
- Use relay for data fetching throughout the application.
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Avoid hardcoding links within the application. Use the links map in lib/links.ts instead, and use that to route within the application.
