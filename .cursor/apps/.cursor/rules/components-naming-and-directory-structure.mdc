- Favor named default exports for components.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use pascal case for the component file names (eg: components/<dir>/ExampleComponent.tsx)
- Define custom hooks in a separate lib/hooks/ directory, except for context hooks that can be defined alongside the provider.
- Ensure that components used in the app directory are placed under the components/ directory in each project.

For example:
/app/page-1/page.tsx has components in:
/components/page-1/ directory.

- Use /components/shared/ directory for shared components.
- For RSC pages, to aid with relay data fetching, define the relevant ClientComponents for the pages in the app directory itself.

For example:

/app/rsc-page-1/
    page.tsx
    Page1ClientComponent.tsx

- Define other client components used in layouts (like HeaderClientComponent) in the app directory itself.
