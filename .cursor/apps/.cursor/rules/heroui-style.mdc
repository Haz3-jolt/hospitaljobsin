- Rely on the HeroUI react library to provide components for building the frontend applications.
- Prefer to use shadow="none" on components at all times, except for when we need to showcase depth (like in a navbar popup)
- The design theme is generally flat, light colored theme (white with a green shade as the primary color)
- Always use the HeroUI configured theme colors (variables) throughout the application. This makes it easier to configure the color palette from one place.
- Ensure that the design is mobile friendly always.
