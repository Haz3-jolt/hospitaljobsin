- Use Hero UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Prefer to use shadow="none" on components at all times, except for when we need to showcase depth (like in a navbar popup)
- The design theme is generally flat, light colored theme (white with a green shade as the primary color)
