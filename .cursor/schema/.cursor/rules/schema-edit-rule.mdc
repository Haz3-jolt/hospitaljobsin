The file [schema.graphql](mdc:schema/schema.graphql) should not be edited manually. It is autogenerated by running the following command:
```bash
cd server
uv run strawberry export-schema app.schema:schema > ../schema/schema.graphql
```

This file must be regenerated every time after the GraphQL schema related code changes.
