- Use the Beanie ODM to define MongoDB collections.
- Ensure the fields that will be used to access documents frequently are indexed.
- Make use of constraints (like the unique constraint) wherever relevant.
- Add Beanie `Link`s to add references to other collections.

- After adding/ updating `Links`, make sure to edit the reference forwarding logic in [__init__.py](mdc:server/app/database/__init__.py) to ensure
  that the references will be loaded correctly when Beanie intializes. This is to prevent circular imports.
