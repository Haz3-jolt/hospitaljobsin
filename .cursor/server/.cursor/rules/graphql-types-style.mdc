- In case of circular import errors, make use of the `strawberry.lazy` function to fix it.
- Add a classmethod called `marshal` on every @strawberry.type class that converts the given document/data into an instance of the class itself.
- Add a classmethod called `to_document` on every @strawberry.input class that converts the current input class into an instance of a Beanie document.
- Reuse the `BaseConnectionType` and `BaseEdgeType` classes at [types.py](mdc:server/app/base/types.py) when defining Connection types.
