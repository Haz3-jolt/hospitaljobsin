# TODO- seeker portal

- add applied jobs list (linkedin has both applied and saved jobs on the same page- differentiated by a filter)

- we need a separate resource that can return the searched jobs
aaa

- if prompt is show me jobs satisfying XXX conditions, we get a tool call done to call the appropriate jobs. we handle that and show the result client side.
- we can add other tools too, like showing current applications, saved jobs etcaaa

# TODO- recruiter portal
- add pagination to job view metrics (normal connections should be enough??)
- add org level stats
- add time based stats- number of views, impressions using MongoDB timeseries collections
- add select option type applicant field
- add option to use screening questions and apply via the app (called EasyApply on Linkedin), or redirect to a custom application link (cannot be changed after job is published)
- if you have an external application link, you CANNOT see applicants in dashboard. this feature cannot be changed after creating the job.
- add setting in organization that mentions whether jobs are handled within the app by default (to help in job creation UI)
- list applications
- show applicant detail view
    - show applicant's form data
    - show applicant's job seeker profile
- group applications into stages:
    - waiting for review
    - waiting for interview
    - selected

Go through the setup guides of the services above, which covers installation of required dependencies,
and other service specific setup tasks.

To start all services in development, run the following command:

```bash
tmuxinator start medical_jobs
```

### Running E2E tests
1. Stop the currently running services:
    ```bash
    tmuxinator stop medical_jobs
    ```
2. Start the docker compose E2E services:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up --wait --build --remove-orphans -d
    ```

3. Run the E2E tests:
    ```bash
    cd e2e
    pnpm run test
    ```
