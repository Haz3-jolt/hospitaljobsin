## TODO (auth)

add accounts center
where:

- users can delete their accounts
- when user is stuck while verifying their 2FA code, allow them to use their passkey, like Github (for better UX) CONDITIONALLY
  (GITHUB SUPPORTS sms, security keys and authenticator apps as valid 2FA methods)
- we need to store the auth providers of the users in some way or another while issuing the 2fa challenge
 (GitHub seems to store this in the session itself)
- add modal before deleting passkeys, sessions, and delete all sessions
- option to disable password
- If the user loses access to their 2FA device, provide secure fallback options:
    Alternative 2FA Methods: Allow authentication via email or backup phone number.
    Manual Verification via Support: If no 2FA method is available, require identity verification (e.g., ID document upload or security questions).

Github Uses SECURITY KEYS only as a form of 2fa, not PASSKEYS.
hence our current setup is correct
